This article will help you get your HP laser jet printer hooked up to your Wi-Fi network.

There are three different ways to do it number one is the easiest and we recommend trying that first. If that doesn't work skip to number two if that doesn't work hopefully number three will help you out. This write up is specifically for the model printer hp m102. These same methods will work with a lot of hp LaserJet printers such as the m107w, m15w, m118dw, and  probably a lot of desk jets and inkjets and all-in-ones that don't have a navigation screen on it and just have Wi-Fi buttons.

A lot of the technology overlaps so even though this isn't exactly your printer hopefully some of these methods will work for you. Don't throw the printer out the window, your time and hopefully one of these methods will get your HP printer hooked up to your Wi-Fi network.

•	The first way we're going to set this up on a Wi-Fi network is using the built-in wps function Wi-Fi protected setup. This is the easiest way to do it and is a lot easier.

•	Turn your printer on and it should be just blinking blue meaning that it's looking for Wi-Fi signals but it's not connected to anything.

•	Activate the wps mode on this printer and then activate wps mode on the router, they're going to link and they will connect. In order to get the printer in wps mode hold the Wi-Fi membrane button for 5 seconds and then let it go. It should blink with a green and a blue button as before it was just blinking with a blue button.

 Go over to your Wi-Fi router; activate the wps depending on your brand it might be in a different spot usually it is on the side. Hold that wps button down on the router

•	Power button will now start blinking. This opens up network for a temporary amount of time for a device that's searching for the network with wps to connect to the router.

•	If you have one of the newer routers you might have to hold the sync button down in order to activate wps. It is going to blink for a while but eventually you will see a solid blue light. This indicates printer is connected to the network.

 

## Second Method

For second method to set up your HP laser jet printer on your Wi-Fi network

We’re going to use an ipad. You can also do this from an android phone. It's pretty much the same process you'll just have to download the app from the play store.  If the ipad printer is on the Wi-Fi you're going to want to go to the app store and type in HP smart app. Download, install, and click open. This is what you're going to be using for an initial setup for a printer that hasn't been set up to any other network in the past. If you're trying to connect your printer to a new network you might have to try option three.

 

To continue with this method click continue.  Click “no” in case you do not wish to sign in. To set up a new printer click ok to use Bluetooth.  Swipe down or turn Bluetooth on some printers can connect via Bluetooth and set up settings that way. Your printer may or may not allow the set up via Bluetooth so try using the app.  Click on the Wi-Fi settings and select HP setup. Settings are the gear icon. Make sure you're on Wi-Fi and you're looking for an HP setup Wi-Fi network. There's no password on it. The printer name and number depending on your printer model will show up. Click it and connect to that Wi-Fi network. Swipe or click to move out of the app. And then click open HP smart app. The app will automatically detect the printer because you have your device connected to the Wi-Fi network that the printer is emitting. Change the network if for some reason that's not the correct network. Click change network and then scroll through the available networks on display. Type your password. Make sure you get this correct, if it is case sensitive it needs to be keyed in correct. Click on continue. This will basically going to tell the printer which Wi-Fi you want it to connect to.  As your printer is getting programmed you will notice that printer blue light goes from blinking to solid.

 

Click on continue. This printer is now on your network and you can share it with your connected devices on Mac, or windows. The connected phone and tablets all those will work with this printer. For android you're going to have to download HP print service plug-in for apple devices. There after you should be able to just open up the file you want to print. Look for the square with the up arrow scroll down to print and then using the air print driver you should be able to send the file right over to your printer.

 

## Third Method

The third method that hopefully will be able to get you onto the Wi-Fi network is to direct Wi-Fi connect into the printer.

Go to the settings; manually change the Wi-Fi settings on the printer and it will be connected to your wireless network. You can do this through the ipad or through a computer you can also do it through a phone/ tablet. For ipad as demonstration purposes go to the gear icon. Wi-Fi depending on your printer going to be different but it's going to be direct HP and then some numbers. Click on the same and then key in your password. Click “join”. If you don't see the desired Wi-Fi network there might be a button on your printer to activate that network.  Now click one a browser windows and navigate to 92.168.223.17:22. Then hit enter to get connected to the printer. Hopefully you will get the Printer connected to the Wi-Fi.  To connect as wireless configurations make sure your device network status is on join an existing wireless network. Select gigahertz (2.4/5). Navigate to your Wi-Fi network, type in your network password.  Click “apply”.  The printer light will change from blinking to a solid blue light.  At this moment try to send a test print to the printer. Open a file and hit print. Select printer and print. You can install this printer on your other devices if you want to by installing it either with an app or with a driver depending on what you're on. Maybe a Mac a windows or pc.
